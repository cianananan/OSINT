## Performing Gap Analysis
### Ask a lot of Questions
1. Who?
2. What?
3. When?
4. Where?
5. Why?
6. How?

### Using Gap Analysis
1. What **do** we know?
2. What does the information mean?
3. What **do** I still need to know?
4. How **do** I find out?

### Reflect on Failures & Wins
1. What part is taking the most time?
2. Is this necessary **for** the investigation?
3. What could I change in my process?
4. Could any part be automated?
5. Who could I ask **for** input/advice?
